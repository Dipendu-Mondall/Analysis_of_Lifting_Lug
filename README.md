 Structural Analysis of a Lifting Lug using Ansys


ðŸ”© Structural Analysis of a Lifting Lug using ANSYS ðŸ”© In this project, I analyzed the Factor of Safety (FoS) and deformation of a lifting lug under load conditions using ANSYS. Understanding these parameters is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of lifting components in engineering applications. Check out my report for detailed insights!
